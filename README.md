# SLiCK-Dayz_Batch_Files
 My personal batch files for starting, log purging, and doing a full wipe.

 You will need to adjust setting in the start.bat file to represent your server values.

I use these on my DayZ Expansion servers, you may need to adjust things in all three batch files.

Place these in the root of your dayzserver folder, and run.
